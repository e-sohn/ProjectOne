Defend the Castle is a game where the goal is to keep the castle intact before the enemy destroys it. There will be 20 goblins traversing the field starting from the left side and making their way to the wall on the right side. Players will click on the goblin to kill them. If the goblin reaches the wall on the right side, players health will reduce by one. If the health reaches 0, the player loses and the game will restart to the home page.
